## Hey! I'm Sushmitha Mallesh 👋


I am a Full-stack developer currently working on LLMs and RAG applications.


Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Bureau.id](https://www.bureau.id/) for two years, where I was part of the early engineering team. During my time there, I contributed to developing the No-code Identity Decision Platform and the One-click payment offering, Blaze.


I started my career at [NI](https://www.ni.com/en.html), working on WebView. As part of a five-member WebView team, I helped build a solution to port the G language (NI's proprietary language) compiler, written in C++, to the web using WASM. I also worked on developing essential debugging tools and features, including breakpoints and probes, to enhance the developer experience.
