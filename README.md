## Hey! I'm Sushmitha Mallesh ðŸ‘‹
I am a Full-stack developer currently working on LLMs and RAG applications.
Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Bureau.id for two years, where I was part of the early engineering team. During my time there, I contributed to developing the No-code Identity Decision Platform and the One-click payment offering, Blaze.
I started my career at NI (National Instruments), working on WebView. As part of a five-member WebView team, I helped build a solution to port the G language (NI's proprietary language) compiler, written in C++, to the web using WASM. I also worked on developing essential debugging tools and features, including breakpoints and probes, to enhance the developer experience.
